Parme version `0.7.0` has been released. 

## Changes

* More crashes addressed when running in international cultures
* **Breaking API Change**: Monogame render groups now require a sample state to be passed in for rendering the particles.  If unsure `GraphicsDevice.SampleState[0]` can be passed in.
* Editor will now properly preview particles with different sample state types
* A new *Ending Size* modifier has been added, which allows specifying the desired size of each particle at the end of its lifetime
* A new *Random Rotation* initializer has been added, which allows giving particles a random starting rotation offset.
* A new *Texture Based Size* initializer has been added, which allows setting each particle's size based on the texture section it's using.  This is useful if multiple texture sections have been defined with different sizes on the sprite sheet.
* Wedge velocity initializer now allows randomizing the magnitude between a min and max value.  This allows for non-uniform displays.
* A *Duplicate* button has been added when defining texture sections, to make it quick to create multiple texture sections that have common values.
* Fixed issues when attempting to set the ending color modifier's alpha value to a value that's not `0.0` and `1.0`.
