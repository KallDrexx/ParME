# ParME (Particle Manipulation Engine)

**This project is still under heavy early development**

Parme is a suite of engine agnostic libraries and tools to make it easy to design and manage emission and particles for 2d games.  

Currently ParME contains:

* Json based file format for defining behavior or emitters and particles
* Desktop WYSIWYG editor for designing emitters and particle behaviors
* Tools for converting a Parme emission logic file into efficient C# code
* Monogame rendering support
* Advanced integration for the [FlatRedBall Engine](https://flatredball.com)

## Branding

Branding can be found in the branding folder. Usage guidelines:

* Use the regular versions on light backgrounds
* Use the reverse versions on dark backgrounds
* Use the mark for branding where the full name is unimportant
* Do not stretch, squeeze or recolor the logo
* Avoid using the logo on colorful backgrounds, black or white offers the best readability
